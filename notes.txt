Things To Note:

- AvailableTimes is really the entry root component for the application
- The week component is most likely the place that would be the root of the time signifier 
  - the week component is where we can place the current line signifier for determining where to load the current hour
  - week.css is where we put the actual CSS rules for the line (should probably make this configurable)
